# Blender-Projects
3D Modeling and Animation Projects from my classes and my own free-time.

The ones titled "City Defender" are from a potential video game concept I would like to create in the future.
The title is a work in progess, but I decided to create the animations for the robot in my free-time.

The Poke Ball project is just another project done in my free time based on an item from the Pokemon franchise.

The Table Bottle project is my Multimedia Computing class in the Fall 2021 semester. It was two projects for the class.
Our goal was to start to learn Blender by making the models and animation for a bottle falling from a table.

The Wii Bowling project is from my Multimedia Computing class in the Fall 2021 semester. It was our final project for the class.
I was in charge of the animations, modelling the Nintendo Miis, coordinating the group, and piecing everyone's contributions together.
The rest of my group members for this project were my classmates Eric Dolph, Shane Thomas, and Daniela Bautista.

Due to the file size, the Table Bottle and Wii Bowling Projects had to be zipped to be uploaded.
